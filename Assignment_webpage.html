 <h1 style="color: #009999">AUV-IITB</h1>
 <p style="color: #009999">AUV-IITB comprises 55+ highly enthusiastic and hard-working technocrats on underwater robotics ranging from freshmen to driven senior undergraduates and experienced post-graduates spanning various branches of engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay.We work on Matsya, a series of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs)to deliver a research platform in underwater robotics and promote autonomous systems. Significant architectural changes have been made to the subsystems by designing them to handle tasks in real-time. Some of the key features include improved heat dissipation, debug board, competition friendly mission planner.
